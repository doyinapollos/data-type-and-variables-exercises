                "Fizzbuzz" is a famous interview question used in programming interviews. It goes something like this:
                Loop through the numbers 1 to 100
                If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
                If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
                If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
                If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number
